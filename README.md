http://blog.nerdability.com/2013/03/tech-building-rss-reader-android-app.html

We have built a simple RSS reader app for Android (3.0+) as part of a tutorial on parsing RSS feeds on the platform. 

The app is fully functioning and is ready to be forked/downloaded and run on any compatible Android device/emulator - it will pass the http://nerdability.com blog.

It also has some other built in features such as a basic DB tracking which posts you have already read.
